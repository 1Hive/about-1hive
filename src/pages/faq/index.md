### How to buy HNY.
Check this [step by step guide](href=https://medium.com/@whitecolidon/honey-token-how-to-buy-it-c48802e2e881).

### What's the HNY total supply and where can i check it.

HNY current total supply is currently approximately 25000. The total supply is changes as honey issued at an adjustable rate per year that goes directly into the common pool. Currently this rate is 0.000000019% per block, or approximately 60% percent per year assuming 5 second block times.

This rate is directed by honey holders, and therefore is potentially subject to change. However, there is interest in adopting a more predictable issuance policy with a less discretionary governance policy.


You can check total supply and current price at [1hive.org](https://1hive.org/#/).

### How is it distributed?

The issuance and distribution model for Honey is simple, each block new Honey is issued and accumulates into a common pool, from there it is distributed using a proposal and staking process called conviction voting.

Anyone can submit a proposal requesting a portion of the common pool be allocated to a specific beneficiary. Honey holders can stake on the proposals to signal their support. You can access the Honey issuance and distribution dashboard at 1hive.org.

### How to claim my first HNY from the faucet?

You have to be verified with BrightId and be sponsored.

You can check this [guide](https://medium.com/@whitecolidon/the-honey-faucet-ccd0d2a368db) for how to do it.

After you are verified and sponsored you can register for periods and claim some HNY. Registering for a period will let you claim HNY on the next period.


Each period lasts 2 days and you'll need to register to the faucet each period. By claiming on a period, you'll be automatically registered for the next period. Not claiming in a period will forfeit the unclaimed amount.

We have set up a bot in the `#üçØhoney` channel that reminds you to claim your HNY each period. Don't forget!
