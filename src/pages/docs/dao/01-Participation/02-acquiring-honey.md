title: Acquiring Honey
---

Honey is the community currency of 1hive, it is also an important community boundary. In order to influence the direction of 1hive, honey holders (also called **keepers**) can stake their honey on proposals.

In order to participate in this process you must first acquire some honey. Currently there are 4 primary ways to do this:

1. Get validated on brightid and register and claim honey from the [faucet](https://faucet.1hive.org). 

2. Contribute to the 1hive community on github, discord, and discourse. These contributions are tracked using sourcecred to generate "pollen", which is like a contributor score. Honey is distributed weekly on the basis of these scores.

3. Look for something you can do to improve 1hive and submit a funding proposal to the DAO.

4. Buy honey on [Honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org).
