Over the past week we have seen an explosion in people, energy, and capital flow into the 1hive community. Welcome everyone!

We are stoked that everyone is as excited as we are about Honey. There are many possibilities for shared value creation that a thriving decentralized and autonomous community can manifest.

That being said‚Ä¶ rapid parabolic growth has its challenges! Over the past week we have experience many of them.

## On the technical side
- Over the weekend the 24 hour transfer limit of 100,000 Dai was hit multiple times, before the bridge validators were able to increase the limit.
- The brightid social graph has experienced massive growth as people look to get verified in order to participate in the honey faucet, making a process which should be relatively easy feel like a huge and even slightly unfair hurdle.
- The Graph which is essential to most of our frontend applications, has been fairly inconsistent, likely due to a disparity in capacity directed towards the xDai network relative to Ethereum.
- An anonymous member of the community reported an issue with the conviction voting app configuration, prompting an adjustment which will disable execution of funding proposals until we can pass a vote to change the configuration (more on this later).


## On the social side
- Documentation is a tool for social scalability. Limited docs is fine if people are tightly coordinated, but as the number of people trying to coordinate increases the need for solid documentation becomes imperative. We still have relatively little documentation available, but we‚Äôre getting more and more every day!
- Social norms and moderation policies help ensure that a community remains a cohesive and enjoyable environment. A rapid influx of people, who are not familiar with a communities social norms, results in tension. To help with this we‚Äôre creating guides to help people onboard and contribute to the community (and earn üçØ in the process!).

## The weeks ahead‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶are the most critical the 1hive community will likely face, and we hope we can come together to ensure that the seeds we plant today will grow into something truly amazing üå≥ üêù üçØ

As a decentralized autonomous organization, we are closer to a complex dynamic system than a company. As such, the initial conditions of that system have a profound effect on the result. While the same mechanisms can be copied infinitely, the initial conditions that make them succeed are scarce opportunities. Every fork of bitcoin is just a fork, every ethereum killer is just kidding themselves, but with 1hive we have the potential to create something unique and disruptive - by and for the community.

And our community cares! Today an anonymous community member found a reported a configuration issue in the BeeHive. No üçØ was lost and we have created an administrative vote to resolve the issue. Anyone with honey can choose to participate in this vote, but there is already sufficient support and no need to take action **(note that if you do participate in the vote and vote yes your tokens will be locked until the vote is concluded)**. The vote duration is set for 2 weeks with 2 day delay before it can be executed, and no conviction funding proposal will be able to be executed during that time.

But there‚Äôs good news: we‚Äôre going to start farming Honeycomb! The bees are swarming and together we‚Äôll coordinate to find the best pools to farm. Then when conviction funding proposals are re-enabled we‚Äôll flow üçØ to HoneySwap LPs!

This is a fortuitous opportunity for the 1hive community to come together, take a breath, and consciously take steps to optimize our initialization conditions to maximize long term potential. Our friends at the Commons Stack, would call this the ‚ÄúCultural Build:‚Äù establishing the processes, moderation tools, and social expectations that help communities successfully scale. We have two weeks to get ourselves in shape before conviction funding proposals turn back on and we let the honey flow with liquidity mining incentives! We urge everyone in the community to use this time wisely and take steps to solidify our cultural foundation.


## üêù Built by Bees!
As a reminder, 1Hive is a community. There are long time community members who want to see 1Hive thrive, but there is no core team. The community has bootstrapped organically, and all the funds in the common pool are stewarded by the community as a whole. It is your responsibility as a community member to contribute where you can, if you see something you don‚Äôt like speak up, take initiative, and help make 1hive what we all want it to bee!

[We want to hear from you!](https://discord.com/invite/D6pZzxU)

- What should be the guidelines for submitting proposals?
- How can we ensure accountability for proposal grantees?
- How could we improve community onboarding?
- How do we create the most shared, sustainable value?
- What Honeyswap pools are most important to incentivize?

Let‚Äôs build a culture together, and remember, this is just the beeginning üêù üçØ !
